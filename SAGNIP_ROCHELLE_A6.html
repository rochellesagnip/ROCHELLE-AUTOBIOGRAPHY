    <p> <b>Rochelle Sagnip</b>, known as <i>"Rochelle"</i> or <i>"Elle"</i> <b>born on October 26</b> , in Malolos Bulacan. With 20 years of experiences and learnings, she has emerged as a dynamic individual with a passion for technology and community building.

        Her journey in the realm of technology began at National University Baliwag, where <em>she pursued a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology Major in Mobile and Web Application. A 2<sup>nd</sup> year student </em> It was here that she <i>honed</i> her skills and developed a <i>keen</i> interest in mobile and web development.
        
        Rochelle's dedication and talent did not go unnoticed, she was a former Promotion and Certifications Lead for the Google Developer Student Clubs. Her contributions to the tech community were further recognized when she assumed the role of Vice-Chief Marketing Officer of AWS Cloud Clubs at National University Baliwag.
        
        Beyond her academic and professional pursuits, <strong>Rochelle is deeply involved in community engagement.</strong> She currently serves as a block representative of the NU Literates Community, where she actively contributes to fostering a culture of literacy and learning among her peers.
        
        In her personal journey of self-discovery, Rochelle identifies with the <b>INFP-Assertive personality type </b>, known for its creativity, empathy, and <i>introspection</i>. Astrologically, she is guided by the cosmic influences of her  <b>big three: Scorpio Sun, Scorpio Moon, and Aquarius Rising</b>, which shape her unique perspective and approach to life.
        
        As Rochelle continues to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of technology and community building, she remains committed to making a positive impact and inspiring those around her with her <b>passion, creativity, and dedication.</b>

    <h2 id="interest">Interests</h2>

    <p>
        In her leisure time, <b>Rochelle indulges in a variety of interests.</b> She has a passion for singing and often finds herself lost in melodies, <em>expressing herself through music</em>. Rochelle also has a deep affection for animals, finding joy in their company and advocating for their welfare.

        Another one of Rochelle's talents lies in music; she can play the trombone, adding a musical dimension to her interests. Despite her love for music, Rochelle's culinary preferences lean towards the spicy side; she enjoys the kick of spicy food but isn't particularly fond of sweets. Favorite drink is H<sub>2</sub>o.

        In terms of entertainment, Rochelle is a fan of bands like <b>My Chemical Romance, Motionless in White, and IV of Spades</b> finding solace and inspiration in their music. Additionally, she finds intrigue in <b>true-crime documentaries,</b> delving into the mysteries and <i>intricacies</i>of real-life cases.

        <b>Astrology also captures Rochelle's interest</b>; she enjoys exploring the depths of astrology and its insights into personality and behavior. And last but certainly not least, Rochelle has a special affection for potatoes; whether mashed, fried, or baked, potatoes never fail to bring her comfort and satisfaction.

    <h2 id="physical">Physical Self</h2>
    <p>
        She has <em>long black-dark brown wavy hair rand lots of moles on her face (5) to be exact.  </em>, 
        She has a normal skin color. Her height is 5'<sup>2</sup> in feet and or 157 centimeters. 
        Her eyes are big and wide. She <b>tends to be insecure because of the moles</b>  she has on her face. 
        Before, people called out her moles and told her that she had a fly on her face. But now, she <em>has learned to love them.</em> Rochelle feels that she is not complete without them. She jokingly thought that they can <strong>become her assets and her trademark </strong>, just like Ms. Nora Aunor and Ms. Charo Santos.
    </p>



    <h2 id="lovelanguage">Love Language</h2>
    <p>
        Based on the <b>Love Language</b>test that she's taken, her love language is an <em>ACT OF SERVICE</em>, followed by <em>QUALITY TIME.</em> She can relate to saying that the result is pretty accurate. When she loves someone, she tends <strong>to do things for them without being asked.</strong>  It is a way for her to show them how she loves them; she does small things that can help their day-to-day life. In her opinion, she is more of a show-and-do person than a vocal one. 
        And when other people do the same for her, like a simple gesture to help her with some chores or even school-related stuff, she feels special and loved. She really appreciates it.
    </p>



    <h2 id="material">Material Self</h2>
    <p> <b>Rochelle keeps things that have sentimental value to her,</b>  even though in the eyes of some, these things can be considered trash.
        Rochelle <em>values material possessions that she already has </em>, but not to the point that she is fully sticking to them.
        Furthermore, <b>Rochelle</b> admits that at some point when she has extra money, she tends to purchase things impulsively, which is not a good habit.
        Now, <strong>Rochelle has learned how not to be persuaded by online shopping applications </strong> and just be contented with the things that she has.
    </p>
    <h2 id="whoisrochelle">Who is Rochelle Now?</h2>
    <p>
        As of right now, <em>Rochelle still doesn't know who she really is. </em> 
        Slowly and carefully, <em>she's trying to understand her inner self, which harbors a darker side she's afraid to share.</em>
        Learning about herself is not an easy task for <em>Rochelle</em>. 
        She acknowledges that she is <strong>unique</strong> and has different needs that must be known and fulfilled for her to fully achieve Self-Actualization. 
        <strong>Rochelle sees herself as a multi-faceted individual who deserves to be loved and accepted by others. </strong>
        Despite her complexity, she believes there are still ways for others to understand her; she just needs to show them who she really is and be honest in her actions. 
        Once <em>Rochelle gains a full understanding of herself, she believes she can establish a great bond with others and become a better person. </em>
        This understanding will make it easier for her to discern her purpose and positively contribute to society.
